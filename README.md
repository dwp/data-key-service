# Data Key Service
DataWorks service to manage the generation and decryption of data keys.

# Build requirements
* Java 8 jdk
* Gradle

# Build instructions
Gradle will fetch required packages and action all of the building. You can start the process by using the gradle wrapper

```bash
./gradlew build
```

# Running locally

## Insecure mode

Gradle can run a local webserver to host the api on port 8080

```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=AWS,KMS,INSECURE ./gradlew bootRun
```

You can then access it for example at http://localhost:8080/datakey


# Secure mode (with Mutual authorisation)

```bash
SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION=resources/config/application.properties ./gradlew bootRun
```

And then to hit an endpoint with the provided self signed-certificates (from the
'resources' sub-directory)

```bash
curl --insecure --cert certificate.pem:changeit --key key.pem \
    https://localhost:8443/healthcheck
```

# Swagger UI

The API has been documented in swagger format (OpenAPI) using code annotations
on the classes. For your convencience you can also view them by running the
service and navigating to

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/data-key-controller
```

or

``` bash
https://localhost:8443/swagger-ui.html#/data-key-controller

```

# Healthcheck endpoint

GET endpoint at ‘/healthcheck’ reports the following

- all dependencies can be reached,
- the current master key id can be fetched,
- a new key can be generated,
- the new key is encrypted
- the new key can be decrypted
- the thumbprint of the certificates of all the trusted clients.

Response code is 200 if everything is OK, 500 otherwise. Example response body:

```json
{
    "encryptionService": "OK",
    "masterKey": "OK",
    "dataKeyGenerator": "OK",
    "encryption": "OK",
    "decryption": "BAD",
    "trustedCertificates": {
        "alice": "AA:11:22 ...",
        "bob": "BB:33:45 ..."
    }
}
```

# Requirements for Data Key Service

## Runtime

* AWS Access via an API Key
* Java 8 JRE
* CentOS

## Infrastructure

* KMS CMK (Master Key), (enabled)
* Parameter Store parameter
  * named ```data_key_service.currentKeyId```
  * value set to the full ARN for the KMS master key
* AWS user must have permissions for:
  * ```ssm:GetParameter``` on the Parameter store parameter
  * Create Data Key, Encrypt Data Key, Decrypt Data Key for the KMS CMK


# Using Docker

## To build an image
```
docker build --tag javacentos:latest .
```

## To run a container
```
docker run -it -p8080:8080 javacentos:latest
```
